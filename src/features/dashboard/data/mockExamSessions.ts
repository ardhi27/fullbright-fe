        userAnswer: `The line graph shows how much milk people in the US drink per person from 1970 to 2015, comparing whole milk and the low fat one. Overall it is clear that people prefer low fat milk more and more and whole milk go down a lot. I think the biggest change is people switch to healthy milk.

In 1970 Americans drank about 25 gallons of whole milk but only around 6 of low fat. By 1980 the figure for whole milk drop to roughly 20 while low fat increased to about 10 liters. This is a very big increase, maybe fifty percent. In the 1990s they are almost the same, near 15 each, so the gap is closed. After that whole milk keeps decreasing to 10 in 2000 and about 6 in 2010, then close to 5 percent in 2015.

On the other hand, low fat went up to around 14 and then it stayed almost stable for many years before a small fall at the end.

To conclude, people changed their habit and moved from full fat to low fat because of health reasons and advertisements etc. The total amount of milk together looks about similar over time, but low fat already overtake the other one around 2000 which shows a strong preference of modern peoples.`,
